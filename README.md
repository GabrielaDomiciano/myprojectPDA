## Introduction

This assessment is based on the Principles of Data Analytics course. During the course, we started by learning how to install Anaconda and configure the environment to work with Python. We used the Jupyter Notebook editor to write and run our code, learning not only Python but also how to use markdown to document our work.
We explore fundamental programming concepts such as variables, data types (such as integers and floats), control structures, and functions. Additionally, we studied essential libraries for data analysis, such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, enabling us to manipulate and visualize data effectively.

Throughout the course, we create histograms to better understand the data, explore data cleaning, and learn how to perform analysis. To consolidate all this knowledge, we conclude the course with a practical data analysis project, where we apply all the skills acquired to explore a data set.
In this project, we will conduct data analysis using Jupyter Notebook, focusing on a dataset about penguins, exploring some variables.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To follow and run the codes you will need to install Python on your computer. You can install Anaconda, on the website you will find a free package and management environment that includes all the necessary packages and libraries for Python programming language.

Anaconda: Anaconda.
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com).

[Pyhton](https://www.python.org).

Python libraries are useful functions and modules that reduce code usage in the program.

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)

[Numpy](https://numpy.org)

(Matplotlib)[https://matplotlib.org]

The editor I used to create Python scripts: (Jupter)[https://jupyter.org]

## To develop the project and analyze the database, I used the following as a reference:

- Classes we had over the semester, the code used as reference [Professor Ian McLoughlin Git Hub](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/mywork/blob/main/iris.ipynb)
- Python Plotting With Matplotlib [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-matplotlib-guide/#understanding-pltsubplots-notation)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.5.3/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html)
- [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)
- I used the ChatGpt to help understand some codes, asking to explain in simple ways, and giving me suggestions on what would be important to include in the Readme.
- Information about de [Palmer Penguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html).
- Following YouTube videos I watched in Portuguese, if you want to watch them, you can enable the subtitles:

## About this project.

![Penguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/figures/palmerpenguins.png)



This dataset contains information about 3 different species of penguins and was collected from 3 different islands in the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica. The data contains characteristics of the penguins, bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, sex, island name, and species name.
